## Dataset Overview

The dataset used (`online_course_recommendation_v2.xlsx`) contains structured information about online courses, including:

- `course_name`: Title of the course  
- `instructor`: Name of the instructor  
- `rating`: User-generated rating of the course  
- `feedback_score`: Aggregated feedback score 
- `difficulty_level`: Difficulty level of the course (Beginner, Intermediate, Advanced)  
- `enrollment_numbers`: Number of learners enrolled  

---

##  How It Works

1. User inputs a keyword (e.g., "python")  
2. The app filters course titles that match the keyword  
3. User selects difficulty level and sorting preference from the sidebar  
4. Filtered and sorted results are displayed in a dataframe  
5. User can optionally include instructor and feedback details  
6. Results can be downloaded as a CSV file
